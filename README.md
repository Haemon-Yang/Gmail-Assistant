# Gmail Assistant

## Description

This project aims to enhance the efficiency of Gmail usage by utilizing LangGraph to create an intelligent agent that assists users with their daily inquiries related to Gmail. The agent can analyze user requirement, transform them into Gmail search syntax and retrieve relevant emails based on specified criteria.

## Features

- The agent can determine if a userâ€™s request is related to Gmail and provide appropriate responses or suggestions.
- It can filter Gmail inboxes based on various parameters such as sender, recipient, subject, body content, attachments, and date ranges.

## Architecture

The project is structured around a workflow that integrates user input with a language model to provide responses. The main components include:

- **LangChain**: For managing the workflow.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: For generating responses based on user input.
- **Colorama**: For colored terminal output.
